Blueprints for the MindMeld Platform

This repo contains blueprints for various conversational apps. A blueprint is a core reference implementation of a MindMeld Workbench conversational app. Blueprints can be leveraged to kick start  development on a new workbench application with 
a similar use case.

## Available Blueprints

### Food Ordering (WIP)

The Food Ordering blueprint is a conversational app for ordering food from a food delivery service such as Amazon Restaurants, Caviar or JustEat. This blueprint will demonstrate building an application for interacting with a number of restaurants with different menus.

### Home Assistant (WIP)

The Home Assistant blueprint is a conversational app for a smart home use case. This app should allow users to control appliances, lights, doors and thermostats. The app can also give meaningful replies to the users inquiring about weather and temperature.
